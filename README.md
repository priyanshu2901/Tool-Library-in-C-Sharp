# Tool-Library-in-C-Sharp
Inventory management system to manage the tools in the store. This project is implemented in C# and some basic datqa structure is also used in this.

All the tools in the tool library are brought through fund raising. Thus, the tool library rents their tools to local residents for free. In the tool library there are nine (9) different types of tools, including gardening tools, flooring tools, fencing tools, measuring tools, cleaning tools, painting tools, electronic tools, electricity tools, and automotive tools. Some tools are identical. Tools are considered to be identical, if they have the same name.   When the tool library purchases new tools, the staff member needs to add the new tools into the inventory management system.  For a new tool, if there exists an identical tool in the tool library, the staff member only needs to increase the quantity of the tool in the inventory management system; otherwise, the staff member needs to enter the name of the tool, a brief description of the tool, and the quantity of the tool, into the inventory management system. When a person rents a tool from the tool library, the full name and a contact phone number of the person are recorded in the inventory management system and when the person returns the tool to the tool library the record is removed out of the inventory management system. In addition, when a person rents a tool from, or returns a rented tool to, the tool library, the quantity of the tool in the inventory management system should be updated. 

The inventory management system meet the following functional and non-functional requirements: 

• Display the information about all the tools of a type selected by the user, including the name of the tool, a brief description of the tool, and the availability of the tool in alphabetical order by the tool names 
• Add new tools to the inventory management system 
• Lend a tool in the tool library to a person 
• Return a rented tool to the tool library 
• A command-line user interface with a functionality menu
